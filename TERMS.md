# GeekFactory Smart Contract Hub — Terms of Use

Last updated: 2026-02-11

These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern access to and use of the GeekFactory Smart Contract Hub (the "Hub").

By accessing or using the Hub in any manner — including through direct canister calls, scripts, user interfaces, or third-party tools — you agree to be bound by these Terms.

If you do not agree, do not use the Hub.

## 1. Nature of the Hub

The Hub is an on-chain infrastructure system for deploying smart contract canisters from listed templates.

The Hub provides infrastructure only.

The Hub does not operate, manage, control, monitor, or intervene in any deployed contract, and is not a party to any transaction executed by a deployed contract.

Each deployed contract is an independent on-chain canister with its own code, state, and lifecycle, determined solely by its deployed on-chain logic and applicable protocol rules.

References to the Hub refer to the on-chain canister(s) and associated protocol logic, and not to any individual, team, or organization, except where required by applicable law.

## 2. No Endorsement or Review

Templates referenced or discoverable through the Hub may originate from any source, including third parties and/or on-chain governance processes.

The presence of any template in or through the Hub does not constitute an endorsement, audit, legal review, or guarantee of correctness, security, legality, or fitness for any purpose.

Any review, validation, labeling, certification, scoring, or governance signaling related to templates (if any) is informational only, non-binding, and must not be relied upon.

Governance actions, if any, affect only the visibility or discoverability of templates or metadata and do not modify, control, or assume responsibility for any deployed contract.

## 3. Beta Status and Governance

The Hub is currently operated in a beta phase.

During this phase, certain operational decisions — such as template listing, blocking, configuration changes, or code updates — may be performed by the GeekFactory team.

Future governance mechanisms, including potential transfer to on-chain or DAO-based governance, may be introduced, but are not guaranteed and create no obligations or expectations.

## 4. Code Is the Sole Source of Truth

The deployed on-chain code of a contract is the sole source of truth regarding its functionality, behavior, parameters, limitations, and outcomes.

No off-chain materials — including documentation, interfaces, template descriptions, validation outputs, certificates, labels, announcements, posts, communications, or community statements — are binding or authoritative.

No off-chain statement or material can modify, supplement, override, or create obligations inconsistent with the deployed on-chain code.

If any off-chain statement or material differs from the deployed on-chain code, the deployed on-chain code controls, and any expectation formed outside the deployed on-chain code is legally irrelevant to the maximum extent permitted by law.

## 5. Deployment, Protocol Resources, and Irreversibility

Use of the Hub may involve on-chain transfers or consumption of protocol-defined resources, including ICP or cycles.

All on-chain actions and transfers are irreversible by design.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, any such transfers are non-refundable, including in cases of failed, partial, or incomplete deployments, or user error.

## 6. No Custody or Control

The Hub itself does not custody or control user assets, funds, identities, credentials, or keys.

The Hub cannot initiate, reverse, modify, or intervene in transactions executed by deployed contracts.

## 7. No Regulatory or Financial Services

Nothing in the Hub is intended to constitute the provision of regulated financial services, exchange services, brokerage, escrow, marketplace operations, investment services, or any other regulated activity.

## 8. No Legal Relationships Between Users

Use of the Hub does not create any partnership, agency, joint venture, fiduciary, or contractual relationship between users.

Users interact with each other and with deployed contracts entirely at their own risk, and the Hub is not a counterparty to any such interaction.

## 9. No Support, Monitoring, or Duty to Warn

The Hub has no obligation to provide support, monitoring, detection, disclosure, intervention, remediation, or warnings regarding vulnerabilities, exploits, misuse, illegal activity, or the behavior of any deployed contract.

Any assistance provided, if any, is discretionary and creates no ongoing obligation.

Knowledge of any issue, vulnerability, exploit, misuse, or illegal activity does not create any duty or liability to act, warn, restrict, or intervene, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

## 10. Assumption of Risk

Use of the Hub involves significant technical, legal, and economic risks, including the risk of permanent loss of assets, data, or control.

By using the Hub, you knowingly and voluntarily assume all risks arising from its use and from any contract deployed through it.

## 11. Disclaimer

The Hub is provided "as is" and "as available", without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory.

## 12. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, no liability shall arise for any loss, damage, or harm resulting from use of the Hub or any deployed contract.

Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability to the extent such liability cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.

## 13. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Hub and any persons or entities involved in its operation or governance from third-party claims arising from your use of the Hub.

## 14. Governing Law

These Terms and any disputes arising out of or relating to the Hub or its use shall be governed by the laws of the Republic of Cyprus, to the maximum extent permitted by law.

## 15. Miscellaneous

If any provision of these Terms is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.

These Terms constitute the entire agreement governing use of the Hub.
